# MedTitration
This is a simple application for the purpose of providing correct titration of medication IV drips. The user inputs an order of what medicine to give, dose, and infuse rate. 
The program then titrates in ml/hr and mg/hr what the rate should be. 
The application is also designed to provide a correct dose of IV push medication based on supply.
